## Usage

The way to use it is by opening index.html and you will get to the main page where you can press "start quiz" to start the quiz and take you further to the quiz.

in the quiz you have 8 questions to answer and you have 10 seconds to answer. when it gets down to 3 seconds the seconds pop out and red text appears. If you don't answer within 10 seconds, the quiz continues by itself.
you also get 100 points for each correct question that you answer. at the end of the quiz, it will appear what you have answered correctly and incorrectly. then you get an option as to whether you want to take the quiz again or not.
